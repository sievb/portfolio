                    <h2>Not understanding technology leaves people vulnerable</h2>
                    <p>Technology is always advancing at a rapid pace and keeping up with it isn't a realistic expectation for most people. Many victims are simply those that are the easiest targets and don't require a lot of effort to exploit.</p>

                    <h2>Website that presents accessible information</h2>
                    <p>The most important aspects of this project was making sure the information was understandable to anyone. A website would provide the best way to reach the widest audience.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>It's important to know what's already out there</h2>
                    <p>I conducted a competitive analysis that can be <a href="docs/delete/deleteCompetitiveAnalysis.pdf" target="_blank">viewed here</a>. There were similar websites already running and I concluded that I needed to offer features they didn't have, such as generators and informational sheets.</p>

            <div class="flexColumn">
                <h1>personas</h1>
                <h2>Understanding the audience</h2>
                <p>To ensure I was following my main goal of accessibility I created personas to ensure I kept my target audience in mind while developing the website.</p>

                <h1>mockup</h1>
                <h2>Designing for use</h2>
                <p>Since the purpose of this website was to inform visitors I wanted to make it easy for people to find relevant information. Right after the landing page is a section that directs visitors to the most appropriate page based on their knowledge.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Visitors could choose between starting with the very basics of online safety, or choosing from another page that listed out all the available topics. Then if they wanted to learn more they could find a list of other resources.</p>

            <div class="flexColumn">
                <h1>problems</h1>
                <h2>Changing in the middle</h2>
                <p>Originally my project idea dealt with disaster preparedness, I then changed it because I felt like that topic was extremely broad and not many people were really focusing on online safety. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="flexColumn">
                <h2>Cutting out features</h2>
                <p>Due to my pivot I had less time to fully flesh out my idea and had to discard some planned ideas to ensure the quality of what was going to be included. The biggest feature that didn't make it were downloadable information sheets, I was also unable to find a password testing API and only managed to include a password generator.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="flexColumn">
                <h1>outcome</h1>
                <h2>The final product</h2>
                <p>Working with the deadline and project constraints I feel like I managed to create what I envisioned from the beginning, minus some features.</p>

            <div class="flexColumn">
                <h1>reflection</h1>
                <h2>Biggest takeaways</h2>
                <p>The most important learning points this project taught me were to give myself more time than I thought, and to know exactly what I could get done in a certain amount of time so I don't aim for something overly ambitious and fall short.</p>
