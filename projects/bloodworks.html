        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This project was meant as an introduction to working with real stakeholders and taking into consideration any constraints when conceptualizing solutions. Learning about best practices and design processes is wholly different from applying them and learning from that experience.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>It was difficult to stop from thinking about how the training process at Bloodworks NW could be improved, especially when observing it firsthand. But a solution couldn't really be conceptualized without understanding where the issues were and getting the qualitative data that supported those theories. After obtaining a wealth of information from two field observations and an interview with our stakeholder, the group set out to analyze it for anything that could point to a solution. After some deliberation and brainstorming over 100 ideas, it came back down to an online training program that could be accessed from anywhere. This was in line with what our data showed and our stakeholder's idea of needing the actual training part of the training process to be portable, as scheduling times for training sessions was arduous and they took exorbitant amount of time to complete.</p>
        <p>After deciding on the online training solution, the group needed to create a mockup to show how it could possibly look like, and to give our stakeholder something they could work off from if they wanted to implement our solution. I used Illustrator to create the different screens of the application and to somewhat simulate how it would be used.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>I knew from the beginning of the project that I wanted to work on my design and prototyping skills. Being able to create something that looked somewhat professional and realistic was very empowering and encourages me to continue learning more and improving myself. It's also highlighted some areas where I need to focus on the most, such as wireframing and getting a very good idea of how I want something to look, before I start making a higher fidelity mockup. However, I think I was successful in my goal of showing myself that I can design, as long as I put effort and get critique from others.</p>
