      <h2><span class="bold">Purpose</span></h2>
      <p><span class="italics">Delete Yourself</span> was made as a final project for a class during fall quarter of 2017. The project assignment was to create a website that revolved around a social justice issue or having some sort of social impact. I chose to focus on online safety, as technology is continuing to advance at an astounding rate, but that doesn't mean peoples' general understanding of it is on the same level, which can leave them vulnerable to being exploited by others. My intent was to inform visitors about how to stay safe online as well as other related aspects, such as privacy on social media and securing mobile devices.</p>
        <h2><span class="bold">Development</span></h2>
        <p>Before actual development on the website could start, it was necessary to create artifacts that would shape the design of the website and allow for a greater understanding of the intended audience and the overall goals. After researching, designing and further revising these artifacts, I was in a much better place to begin forming a functional website. Everything was hand-coded and combines HTML, CSS, and Javascript upon the CakePHP framework for an accessible and attractive website; MySQL was used to manage the database of information from which the website pulled to fill the current page they were on.</p>
        <h2><span class="bold">Outcome</span></h2>
        <p>This was my first experience with backend development and PHP as well as managing databases using MySQL, through this project I can see just how useful storing information in databases and pulling it using the MVC framework can be for development as well as organization. It was very exciting to be given the freedom to design my website however I wanted and learn new things at the same time. I'd like to build another website sometime in the future to further explore using databases as well as other frameworks.</p>
