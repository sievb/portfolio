        <h2><span class="bold">Purpose</span></h2>
        <p><span class="italics">Fable of Zoldo</span> was a quick foray into game development using Unity during spring quarter of 2018. It was a group assignment meant to apply students' existing skills as well as allow them the opportunity to try out other aspects if they wanted to experiment without fear of repercussions. At the same time we touched upon the topic of absurdism and absurd games, thus each groups' game was also a test of how well we could critically understand a new subject and apply that knowledge in a practical manner and explain how this goal influenced the design choices we made.</p>
        <h2><span class="bold">Development</span></h2>
        <p>The beginnings of this project were slightly rocky due to how open it was, full creative control was handed off to groups as long as the absurdist theme was followed. Of my group only one person had experience with Unity, and even then it was minimal, that guided us to keep our ideas more simple and focus on being able to complete it rather than having a compelling narrative and complex systems in place. While the entire class was working on coming up with game ideas, we were also watching Unity tutorials, one of my group members found a <span class="italics">Legend of Zelda</span> tutorial, which made the decision for us to follow along and find ways to make it absurd. We decided to expand upon the dungeons present in <span class="italics">Zelda</span> and have players go through rooms of dungeons, fighting monsters and culminating in a final boss fight.</p>
        <h2><span class="bold">Outcome</span></h2>
        <p>I was in charge of creating the environmental assets, we went with a pixel art style as we felt that it eased the pressure on us to create detailed sprites, as well as allowing more than one person to work on art. Even though pixel art can be relatively simple, it also poses a challenge with that simplicity; each rooms' tiles needed to be done separately so I couldn't tell exactly what it would look like until I put it all together, meaning if there were any changes that needed to be done to all of the tiles, I needed to go back individually and fix them and then put it back together, hoping it looked right. This was my first time working exclusively on the artistic side of game development, and it seems to have worked out well; I'm interested in exploring more with game development as a whole and going through the entire process on my own to understand and experience as much as I can.</p>
